# This config file is only recognized globally, meaning it is
# only read by the map analyzer if it is in the same directory
# as the EXECUTABLE (not the same directory as a shortcut to
# executable)


# List any number of specific maps to analyze, and use the # character
# to comment out lines:

C:\BLAH\BLAH\A Map That Will Be Analyzed.SC2Map
#C:\BLAH\BLAH\CommentOut-WontBeAnalyzed.SC2Map


# If a directory is listed, all maps in it are analyzed.
C:\BLAB\BLAH\ADirectoryOfMaps

# put an 'r' in front of a directory if you want the map analyzer to
# recursively search that directory for maps to analyze
r C:\BLAB\BLAB\AnalyzeThisDirAndSubDirs
